|  Dataset Name| Description |Related Use case | Source
| -| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----|
| Imputation| The Mushroom dataset that considers a testing set of 2,000 (of 8,124) randomly selected instances. | [Model Selection](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/model-selection/)|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom
|IMDB Confidence | The data consists of 5044 movies with 27 features, however, 25% is sequestered for final assessment. A stratified sampling of 200 movies per class is held out from the 3756 for testing.|[Model Selection and Tuning](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/model-selection-tuning/)|https://www.kaggle.com/suchitgupta60/imdb-data
|recid| This dataset is used for fair learning: the Broward County recidivism dataset, popularized by ProPublica. The data set contains 6,172 instances and 14 numeric features (created by one-hot encoding the categorical features in the initial seven feature data set). 20% are held for testing. | [Fairness Assessment](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/fairness-assessment/)|https://github.com/algofairness/fairness-comparison
| date-12000-strat | The dataset is the TCP collection of historical documents. It took a random sample of 12,000 documents, and held out 30% using stratified sampling. While the testing set is balanced (1,800 per class), the training set is highly skewed (only 15% before 1642)|[Bias and Data Discovery](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/bias-discovery/)|...
| fuzz-mod-5-02 | The data set is a collection of 554 plays written in the Early Modern Period (1470-1660). Five linguistic features are used. It contains four kinds of plays : Comedy, History, Tragedy and Tragicomedy.| [Feature Sensitivity Testing](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/feature-sensitivity/)|...
| tcp-tree-select-9-10 | This dataset considers a corpus of 59,989 documents from a historical literary collection and the data counts the 500 most common English words in each document.| [Model Selection and Data Discovery](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/model-selection-discovery/)|...
| (contunuous) heart disease | The dataset is a standard data set used in machine learning education. Classifiers are trained to predict if a patient is likely to develop a disease (binary decision).| [(Continuous) Model Selection and Calibration Analysis](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/continuous-heart-example/) | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease
| (continuous) wine quality | The dataset is used for wine quality classification, which requires classifying the quality of a wine from its properties. | [(Continuous) Hyper parameter Tuning](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/continuous-tuning/)|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
|(continuous) income | The dataset comes from income classification benchmark dataset from that has been downsampled. Classifiers determine whether an individual’s income is above a certain level. | [(Continuous) Model Selection](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/continous-model-selection/)|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income
|  (continuous) cifar-sampled-scaling | The datset is created based on CIFAR 100 computer vision benchmark using Tensorflow. The data set has 100 classes, and the trained classifier produces a distribution over these classes as its decision.A binary classifier has been created for a “meta-class” which combines 5 of the main classes. This datasets aims to classify flowers, which can be any one of 5 of the original classes. Because the test set contains all 100 classes, it is quite imbalanced: flowers are only 5% of the total instances |   [(Continuous) Model Selection and Detail Examination](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/continous-detail-examination/)|https://github.com/mattdutson/ml-vis
|(continuous) cdate-2500 | This dataset considers a corpus of 59,989 documents from a historical literary collection: Text Creation Partnership (TCP) transcriptions of the Early English Books Online (EEBO). The data counts the 500 most common English words in each document. For the experiment, we took a random sample of 2500 documents, and held out 30% using stratified sampling.  | [(Continuous) Data Examination](https://uwgraphics.github.io/BoxerDocs/docs/use_cases/continuous-exmanination/)|...
